I'm very passionate about computer sciences, especially AI computing. My background is in computational geophysics and I have been a Ph.D. student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), 
Zhejiang, China.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on detecting deep structures (gold, tungsten , tin , groundwater ) using machine learning methodologies as 
researcher in School of Geosciences and Info-physics at [Central South University](https://en.csu.edu.cn/), Hunan China.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++/Node.js/ 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on OpenAI with developers on that field.
