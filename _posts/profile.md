## Profile

I'm a postdoctoral-researcher very passionate about computer sciences, especially AI computing. My background is in computational geophysics and I have been a Ph.D. student at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). 
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on detecting deep resources structures (groundwater, gold, tungsten, tin, groundwater ) using machine learning methodologies at School of Geosciences and Info-physics at [Central South University](https://en.csu.edu.cn/), Hunan China.
