<p>My background is in computational geophysics and I'm very passionate about computer sciences, especially AI computing. I have been a Ph.D. student at <a href=https://www.zju.edu.cn/> Zhejiang University</a>, Zhejiang, China.  

<p>I'm currently working on detecting deep structures (gold, tungsten, tin, groundwater) using machine learning methodologies as a post-doctoral researcher in School of Geosciences and Info-physics at <a href=https://en.csu.edu.cn/>Central South University<a/>, Hunan China.</p>
