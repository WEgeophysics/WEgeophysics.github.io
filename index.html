<p>As a post-doctoral researcher and adept developer of cutting-edge tools, my fervor lies in the realm of 
computer science, particularly in AI computing. My research focus centers on computational geophysics, honed during 
my tenure as a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/">Zhejiang University</a>, China.</p>

<p>Presently, I am immersed in multifaceted geosciences engineering endeavors at the School of Geosciences and 
Info-physics, <a href="https://en.csu.edu.cn/">Central South University</a>, Hunan, China and
the Laboratory of Geology, Mineral Resources and Energy (LGRME), <a href="https://w.univ-fhb.edu.ci/">Félix Houphouët-Boigny 
University</a>, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. My work encompasses the development of intelligent strategies, harnessing the power 
of Machine Learning, to address diverse challenges including deep resource structure detection (e.g., groundwater, tungsten, tin, ...), 
environmental system monitoring such as land subsidence mitigation, sewage seepage monitoring, leachate leakage detection and more.</p>
