subtitle: Geophysicist | Backend-developer

<p>I'm a geophysicist and a backend developer. I'm very passionate about computer sciences, especially AI computing. My background is in computational geophysics and I have been a Ph.D. student at <a href=https://www.zju.edu.cn/> Zhejiang University</a>, Zhejiang, China.  

<p>Iâ€™m currently working on detecting deep structures (gold, tungsten, tin, groundwater) using machine learning methodologies as a post-doctoral researcher in School of Geosciences and Info-physics at <a href=https://en.csu.edu.cn/>Central South University<a/>, Hunan China.</p>

<p>I am also interested in AI tools that can help people fight against water scarcity. This is one of the main reason I created <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org">watex</a>, a Python-based Machine Learning library in hydro-geophysics for minimizing unsucessful drillings and unsustainable boreholes...</p>
