<p> I'm a post-doctoral researcher and developer of intelligent tools. I'm very passionate about computer sciences, especially AI computing. My research interest is computational geophysics, 
and have been a Ph.D. student at <a href=https://www.zju.edu.cn/> Zhejiang University</a>, Zhejiang, China. </p>

<p>I'm currently working on geosciences engineering projects such as detecting deep resource structures (groundwater, tungsten, tin, ...), land-subsidence and environmental mine monitoring 
using Machine Learning through intelligent approaches development at the School of Geosciences and Info-physics at <a href=https://en.csu.edu.cn/>Central South University<a/>, Hunan, China.</p>
